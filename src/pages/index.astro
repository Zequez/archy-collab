      There is no much information about what this is about. It's a prototype,
      an idea, a wish, a dream. It's place where we come together to build the
      web on Archiarchy. Where we have high level fun. Where we connect and
      weave teams.

      Right now this serves as a general workshop space to host multiple modular
      based apps for different people with a same codebase and unlimited domain
      names.
